# Escape the Dungeon Simulation

When the user plays or discusses simulation: read `scratch/game-state.md`, follow `.concept/SIMULATION-AGENT-GUIDE.md`, use `.planning/GRD-escape-the-dungeon.md` for action effects. One player message = one turn. Update game-state.md after each turn; log discovery artifacts when something feels missing.
