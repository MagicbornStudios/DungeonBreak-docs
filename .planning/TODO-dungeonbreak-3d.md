# TODO: DungeonBreak 3D

**Status:** Discovery pending  
**Scope:** Future Unreal Engine 3D adaptation of Escape the Dungeon

---

## Context

DungeonBreak 3D will extend Escape the Dungeon (2D/Kaplay) into a 3D Unreal Engine experience. Actual implementation value will be higher than the current reference build; design requires more systems and behaviors to define as we move from 2D to 3D.

## Prerequisites

- Core systems (engine, formulas, content packs) must be stable
- Content and spaces framework documented
- Stakeholder discovery meeting to align scope and constraints

## Approach

1. **Planning loop** — Use existing planning loop (discuss → plan → execute → verify)
2. **Core systems** — Build on engine contracts, formula registry, space definitions
3. **Content** — Extend content packs for 3D; new room/entity/action definitions
4. **Discovery** — Stakeholder meeting to capture desired outcomes, constraints, non-goals
