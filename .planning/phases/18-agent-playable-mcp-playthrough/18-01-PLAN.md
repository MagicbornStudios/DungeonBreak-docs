# Phase 18-01 Plan

## Objective

Define and implement machine-playable gameplay interface with MCP server adapter and dense deterministic agent playthrough tests.

## Tasks

1. Publish gameplay tool contract:
- create_session
- get_snapshot
- list_actions
- dispatch_action
- get_log_page
- restore_session

2. Build MCP adapter package using shared engine APIs.
3. Add deterministic >= 75-turn agent-run fixtures covering core interaction families.
4. Add regression checks for output determinism and blocked-reason correctness.
5. Align `/play` presenter and MCP action catalog from same source contract.

## Verification

- MCP integration tests pass.
- Agent fixture replay hashes are stable.
- Browser and MCP action catalogs match for equivalent state snapshots.
