# Phase 02: Planning docs cleanup and narrative state-space simulations - Plan 02 Summary

**Generated by forge-loop execute-phase**

## Tasks

- [x] 01. Add Notebook 1: State space and saliency
- [x] 02. Add Notebook 2: Verlet and constraints
- [x] 03. Add README and Plan 02 summary

## Outcomes

- **state-space-saliency.ipynb:** 3D state space with axes Courage, Loyalty, Hunger. One entity at a position; several dialog nodes at fixed locations. Distance from entity to each dialog gives saliency (Gaussian falloff); probabilities computed and used to simulate "which dialog fires" over many samples. 3D scatter plot of entity and dialogs; bar chart of observed trigger frequencies. Illustrates how dialog selection will behave in the game without any game code.
- **verlet-constraints.ipynb:** Verlet integration step and constrain-and-reproject (clamp p to [min, max], set old_p so implied velocity slides along boundary). 2D particle in a box with constant force; 1D particle hitting a max constraint. Trajectory plots show position staying in bounds. Aligns with .planning/narrative-engine-PRD.md §2.2 and §2.3.
- **notebooks/README.md:** Lists both notebooks, prerequisites (Jupyter, numpy, matplotlib), and links to .planning docs.

## Phase 02 status

Planning docs cleanup (Plan 01) and simulation notebooks (Plan 02) are complete. Ready for `forge-loop verify-work 2`.
