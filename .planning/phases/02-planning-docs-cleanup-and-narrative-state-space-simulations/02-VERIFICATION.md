# Phase 02: Planning docs cleanup and narrative state-space simulations Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** PRD and key decisions live in .planning; general docs/ are not extended. Simulation notebooks in `notebooks/` visualize the 3D narrative state space, saliency, dialog triggering, and Verlet+constraints so we can understand and communicate how the system will behave—no game code.
**Status:** human_needed
