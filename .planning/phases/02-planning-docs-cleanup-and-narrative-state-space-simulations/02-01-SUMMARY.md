# Phase 02: Planning docs cleanup and narrative state-space simulations - Plan 01 Summary

**Generated by forge-loop execute-phase**

## Tasks

- [x] 01. Confirm PRD and developer guide live in .planning
- [x] 02. Confirm docs/ pointers only
- [x] 03. Create Plan 01 execution summary

## Outcomes

- **Planning as source of truth:** Full narrative-engine PRD and developer guide are in `.planning/narrative-engine-PRD.md` and `.planning/narrative-engine-developer-guide.md`. They include 3D slice, saliency formula, triggering wording, and references to `notebooks/`. No planning content was added to general `docs/`.
- **docs/ pointers:** `docs/narrative-engine-PRD.md` and `docs/narrative-engine-developer-guide.md` are short pointers to the .planning versions. `docs/image-catalog.md` was updated to state that full content lives in .planning and notebooks are in `notebooks/`.
- **Decisions:** Remain in `.planning/DECISIONS.md`. General docs are not extended with planning or discussion content.

## Ready for

Plan 02 (notebooks: state-space/saliency and Verlet+constraints).
