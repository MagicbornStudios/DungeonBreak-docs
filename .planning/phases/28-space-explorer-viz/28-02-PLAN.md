# Phase 28-02 Plan: Space Explorer UX — Sections, Collapse, JSON/3D Toggle

## Outcome

Avoid jam-packed panels. Section content clearly, collapse where appropriate. Main viz area toggles between 3D Plotly and JSON data view in the same parent panel.

## Tasks

1. **Section layout** — Collapsible sections: Report (turn selector), Selected point, KNN list, Leva controls. Use Collapsible/similar for optional blocks.
2. **Viz panel** — Single parent panel for "Space Viz + Data". Tabs or toggle: "3D" | "JSON". 3D = Plotly scatter; JSON = formatted space-data (or filtered subset) in code block.
3. **Less density** — Move Leva to a drawer/panel that can collapse; keep hero minimal; don’t stack everything vertically without grouping.

## Constraints

- Match shadcn theme
- No drag-with-handles for turn (already using dropdown)
- Clusters: still metadata-based (skill branch, dialogue clusterId, type); no algorithmic clustering in this phase

## DoD

- Sections clearly separated; Report/Selected/KNN collapse when empty or on demand — **Done** (details/summary)
- Viz panel has 3D | JSON toggle in same area — **Done**
- Layout feels less cramped — **Done**

## Implemented

- Left: minimal hero + collapsible Report, Selected, KNN sections
- Center: single panel with 3D | JSON tabs; JSON shows player, knn, selected, contentCount
- Right: collapsible Controls (Leva) via details/summary
