# Phase 05: Docs fold into planning and notebook tooling - Plan 01 Summary

## Tasks

- [x] Docs fold: game PRD, design decisions, implementation roadmap into .planning
- [x] Remove redundant docs/ files; keep only image-catalog

## Outcomes

- **.planning/game-PRD.md** created with full game PRD (vision, pillars, loops, world, character, threat, economy, architecture, influences). Image paths use `../docs/` for assets that remain in docs/.
- **.planning/implementation-roadmap.md** created with full phased implementation roadmap (Phases 1–8, Ralph Wiggum loop). Reference to "design-decisions" updated to "DECISIONS".
- **.planning/DECISIONS.md** expanded: design decisions (GDC/research) merged in as a section; phase-level decisions retained at top.
- **docs/ cleanup:** Removed docs/narrative-engine-PRD.md, docs/narrative-engine-developer-guide.md, docs/PRD.md, docs/design-decisions.md, docs/implementation-roadmap.md. docs/ now contains only image-catalog.md and the image assets. image-catalog Quick Reference updated to point to .planning for all text docs.

## Ready for

Plan 02 (notebook tooling).
