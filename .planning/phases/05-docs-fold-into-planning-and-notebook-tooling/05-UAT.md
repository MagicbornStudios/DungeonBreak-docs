## Tests

### 1. docs/ contains only image-catalog (and images). Game PRD, design decisions, and implementation roadmap folded into .planning. Notebook tooling: venv + check/install + JupyterLab from root; no single-notebook run commands. Notebooks are documentation (entities/vectors/dialogue in same space; threshold and options for follow-up).
expected: docs/ contains only image-catalog (and images). Game PRD, design decisions, and implementation roadmap folded into .planning. Notebook tooling: venv + check/install + JupyterLab from root; no single-notebook run commands. Notebooks are documentation (entities/vectors/dialogue in same space; threshold and options for follow-up).
result: skipped
notes: Skipped in non-interactive mode.

### 2. Plan 01 outputs are reflected in code or docs artifacts.
expected: Plan 01 outputs are reflected in code or docs artifacts.
result: skipped
notes: Skipped in non-interactive mode.

### 3. docs/ contains only image-catalog (and images). Game PRD, design decisions, and implementation roadmap folded into .planning.
