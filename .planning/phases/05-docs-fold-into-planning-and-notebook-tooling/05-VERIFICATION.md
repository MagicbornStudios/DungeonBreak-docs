# Phase 05: Docs fold into planning and notebook tooling Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** docs/ contains only image-catalog (and images). Game PRD, design decisions, and implementation roadmap folded into .planning. Notebook tooling: venv + check/install + JupyterLab from root; no single-notebook run commands. Notebooks are documentation (entities/vectors/dialogue in same space; threshold and options for follow-up).
**Status:** human_needed
