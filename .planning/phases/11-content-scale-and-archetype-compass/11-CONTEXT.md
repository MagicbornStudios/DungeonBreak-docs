# Phase 11 Context: Content Scale, Archetype Compass, and Balancing

## Outcome

Ship the Phase 11 backlog as production-ready TypeScript/package features:

- Data-driven content scale for skills, dialogue clusters, and items.
- Archetype compass as first-class runtime model for entities.
- Deterministic balancing harness and reporting tools.

## Constraints

- Keep TypeScript runtime canonical.
- Preserve deterministic replay contracts and canonical seed workflows.
- Avoid hardcoded content growth in engine constructors.
- Maintain docs-site and package consumer parity.

## Non-goals

- New backend services.
- Combat grid introduction.
- Reintroducing Python gameplay runtime.

## Acceptance Signals

- Archetype heading/compass visible in status surfaces.
- Expanded content packs loaded from schema-validated contracts.
- Balance harness outputs deterministic aggregate metrics.
- Build, unit tests, replay smoke, and browser e2e all pass.
