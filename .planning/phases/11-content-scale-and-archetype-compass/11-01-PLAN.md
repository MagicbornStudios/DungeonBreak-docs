# Phase 11-01 Plan

## Objective

Close the remaining Phase 11 backlog with implementation + verification across package and docs-site.

## Tasks

1. Contracts and content packs
- Add archetype and dialogue cluster packs.
- Expand skill and item packs with richer data-driven definitions.
- Update contract parser/export surface.

2. Runtime integration
- Add archetype director and ranking/classification logic.
- Wire archetype refresh into game lifecycle and status output.
- Replace hardcoded skill/dialogue defaults with contract-derived builders.

3. Balancing tooling
- Add deterministic simulation harness (`simulateBalanceRun`, `simulateBalanceBatch`).
- Add report scripts for package and docs-site consumption.

4. Browser/docs visibility
- Surface archetype heading + compass in `/play` status panel.
- Add unit tests covering pack sizes, status shape, and harness determinism.

5. Verification
- Package: build + replay smoke + balance harness smoke.
- Docs: unit tests + production build + Playwright `/play` smoke.

## Exit Criteria

- All Phase 11 tasks in TASK-REGISTRY are done.
- REQ-68/69/70 are satisfied and traceable.
- Phase 11 summary artifact records delivered scope and verification evidence.
