# Phase 26-01 Plan: Replay Viewer Implementation

## Tasks

1. **ReplayViewer component** — Accepts report (seed, run.actionTrace). Holds currentTurn (0..N). useMemo: create GameEngine(seed), replay 0..currentTurn-1, collect snapshot + feed messages. Renders ActionPanel (disabled), FeedPanel, StatusPanel, Timeline.
2. **Timeline** — Scrollable list of turns. Each row: playerTurn, actionType. Click → setCurrentTurn(i+1). Highlight current.
3. **Reports page** — When data loads, render ReplayViewer above metrics. Pass full report (not just summary). Show metrics sections below.

## Data flow

- /api/play-reports returns { report, analysis }. Report has seed, run.actionTrace, run.turnTimeline.
- ReplayViewer(report) → replays to currentTurn → snapshot + messages → 3-column read-only layout + timeline.
