# Phase 17-01 Plan

## Objective

Lock implementation contract for content expansion + long-run balancing loops.

## Tasks

1. Add schema entries and baseline data packs for quests/events/dialogue depth growth.
2. Implement long-run deterministic simulation suite (100/250/500 turns).
3. Emit balance artifacts (usage distribution, archetype spread, survival rates, dead-content report).
4. Validate pressure/perf budgets under expanded entity/content load.
5. Update planning and GRD summaries with outcomes and tuning actions.

## Verification

- Package build + replay smoke + balance harness pass.
- Docs unit tests + `/play` e2e pass.
- Long-run suite reports generated and archived.
