# Phase 17-02 Plan

## Objective

Complete content-contract expansion and close long-run performance/budget verification for Phase 17.

## Tasks

1. Expand schema-driven authored packs for quests and events without hardcoded growth paths.
2. Validate engine runtime consumes new contract packs through exported builders.
3. Re-run long-run suites and confirm pressure/perf policy remains in bounds (`p95 <= 2s`, cap `120`).
4. Update requirements/task traceability and phase summaries to mark Phase 17 complete.

## Verification

- `pnpm --dir packages/engine run test:long-run-suite`
- `pnpm --dir docs-site run report:balance-sim`
- `pnpm --dir docs-site run report:vector-usage`
- Requirements REQ-71 and REQ-74 marked Done.
