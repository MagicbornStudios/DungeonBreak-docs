# Phase 06: Lab setup (uv, lab command) and notebook improvements Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Single entry `npm run lab`: uv installed if missing, then Python env + deps, then Jupyter Lab (all notebooks in one place). Rename from notebooks to lab. Notebooks: simulate Kaiza (stats, state), dialogue and vectors, threshold-based options; GDC/reference links in .planning for agents. Fast, clone-and-run setup.
**Status:** human_needed
