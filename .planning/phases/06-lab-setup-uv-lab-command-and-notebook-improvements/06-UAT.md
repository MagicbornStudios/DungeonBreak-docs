## Tests

### 1. Single entry `npm run lab`: uv installed if missing, then Python env + deps, then Jupyter Lab (all notebooks in one place). Rename from notebooks to lab. Notebooks: simulate Kaiza (stats, state), dialogue and vectors, threshold-based options; GDC/reference links in .planning for agents. Fast, clone-and-run setup.
