# Phase 13-07 Plan - Recovery Pivot Contracts

## Objectives

1. Replace the `/play` terminal interaction model with a browser-native 3-column gameplay UI.
2. Lock Assistant UI + shadcn responsibilities and remove required command typing.
3. Record release closeout work needed for first stable terminal binary release.

## Scope

- Update planning control documents (ROADMAP, REQUIREMENTS, TASK-REGISTRY, STATE, DECISIONS, PRD).
- Define Loop 13-08..13-10 execution boundaries.
- Keep Python baseline parity policy in place.

## Deliverables

- Updated planning docs reflecting recovery pivot.
- New loop plans for UI rebuild, test hardening, and release closeout.
- Updated DoD and requirement traceability for clickable gameplay and release publication.

## Verification

- `forge-loop verify-work 13 --strict` (after 13-08..13-10 implementation)
- Traceability check: REQ-36 + REQ-43..REQ-46 mapped in docs.
