# Phase 15-01 Plan - Immediate Cutover and Package Contract

## Objectives

1. Lock TypeScript-only runtime policy and remove Python/notebook ambiguity.
2. Define package contract for `DungeonBreak/engine` (`@dungeonbreak/engine` implementation id).
3. Keep `npm run lab` and install helpers operational after cutover.

## Task Blocks

### Planning and Contract Updates

- Update ROADMAP, REQUIREMENTS, TASK-REGISTRY, STATE, DECISIONS, PRD.
- Record package exports and bundled data requirements.
- Define consumer example expectations and CI validation gates.

### Removal Cutover Preparation

- Create inventory of Python gameplay paths and notebook artifacts to remove.
- Define archival policy (tags/releases) for historical recovery.
- Define “active path” criteria so dead code does not remain in mainline.

### Package Surface Definition

- Engine API contract (`create`, `dispatch`, `snapshot`, `restore`).
- React component contract for out-of-box playable render.
- Bundled default content contract (rooms, items, skills, cutscenes, vectors).

## Verification

- Planning artifacts consistently reflect immediate TypeScript cutover.
- Package-first requirements are traceable and implementation-ready.
- Next loop can execute deletion + package extraction without unresolved contract gaps.
