# Phase 15-02 Plan - TS Cutover Execution

## Objectives

1. Remove Python gameplay runtime and notebook gameplay assets from active repo paths.
2. Retarget `npm run lab` and docs generation/install helpers to TypeScript-only workflows.
3. Ship installable package `@dungeonbreak/engine` with bundled runtime data and out-of-box React component.
4. Wire docs-site consumer and CI/release pipelines to package-first flow.

## Task Blocks

### Runtime Removal

- Remove `src/` Python gameplay modules.
- Remove Python test suite and notebook gameplay files.
- Remove Python-specific scripts/workflows from active paths.

### Package Extraction

- Add `packages/engine` with:
  - engine core exports
  - contracts/data packs
  - replay helpers
  - `DungeonBreakGame` React component
- Build package distributables and types.

### Consumer + CI

- Add docs-site dependency on `@dungeonbreak/engine`.
- Keep `/play` UX while consuming package APIs.
- Add package consumer unit tests.
- Replace terminal Python release workflow with package release workflow.

## Verification

- package build/typecheck pass
- docs-site typecheck/build/unit/e2e pass
- planning artifacts updated to mark Phase 15 complete
