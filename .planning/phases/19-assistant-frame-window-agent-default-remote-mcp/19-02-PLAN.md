# Phase 19-02 Plan

## Objective

Implement Assistant Frame bridge tooling in `/play` and validate host/fallback operation for window-agent gameplay.

## Tasks

1. Add frame action parser/dispatcher utilities and bind them in `play-game-shell`.
2. Expose frame tool surface for status, action listing, action dispatch, and cutscene dismissal.
3. Preserve button-first browser UX when no frame host is available.
4. Add deterministic unit/e2e tests for frame dispatch and host-absent fallback.

## Verification

- `pnpm --dir docs-site run test:unit`
- `pnpm --dir docs-site run test:e2e`
- `/play` remains playable without typed input.
