# Phase 19-03 Plan

## Objective

Ship default-on remote MCP for signed-in users and publish version-coupled play/test report artifacts in CI/release pipelines.

## Tasks

1. Implement `/api/mcp` route with signed-in access policy and hardening baseline.
2. Add remote session isolation, payload validation, per-user rate limiting, and audit metadata.
3. Publish agent integration docs for local stdio MCP, frame mode, and remote signed-in MCP.
4. Update workflows to upload versioned play reports and machine-readable test manifests for docs builds and tagged releases.
5. Close planning traceability (requirements/tasks/state/roadmap) to mark Phase 19 complete.

## Verification

- `pnpm --dir docs-site run typecheck`
- `pnpm --dir docs-site run test:unit`
- `pnpm --dir docs-site run test:e2e`
- `pnpm --dir packages/engine run test:replay-smoke`
- workflow YAML validation via local CI command set and successful branch checks.
