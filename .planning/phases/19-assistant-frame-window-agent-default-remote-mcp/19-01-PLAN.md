# Phase 19-01 Plan

## Objective

Lock scope/contracts before implementation for Assistant Frame integration, default-on remote MCP signed-in access, and release-versioned report artifacts.

## Tasks

1. Update planning docs (`ROADMAP`, `REQUIREMENTS`, `TASK-REGISTRY`, `STATE`, `DECISIONS`, PRD) with Phase 19 policies.
2. Define `/play` Assistant Frame integration contract:
- host bridge lifecycle
- action dispatch mapping
- feed/status sync semantics
- fallback behavior when no host is present
3. Define default-on remote MCP contract:
- `/api/mcp` available in deployed runtime by default
- signed-in authentication required for access
- always-on hardening baseline
- compatibility with existing stdio MCP path
4. Define release-report contract:
- versioned play report artifacts per build/release
- machine-readable pass/fail test manifest per build/release
5. Define verification matrix for 19-02 and 19-03 (unit/e2e + docs checks + artifact checks).

## Verification

- Planning docs contain REQ-81..REQ-88 traceability.
- Phase 19 context + plan artifacts exist.
- `STATE` next action points to 19-02 implementation.
