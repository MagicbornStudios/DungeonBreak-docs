# Phase 01: Planning docs baseline - Plan 01 Summary

**Generated by forge-loop execute-phase**

## Tasks

- [x] 01. Confirm scope alignment
- [x] 02. Confirm Phase 01 context
- [x] 03. Create Plan 01 execution summary

## Outcomes

- **Scope:** PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md, and REQUIREMENTS.md are aligned with DungeonBreak and the Narrative Engine. Phase 01 goal is "Planning docs baseline"; REQ-01, REQ-02, REQ-03 are traced to Phase 01. No code scope in Phase 01.
- **Context:** `01-CONTEXT.md` has desired outcome (consistent planning docs + context + plan with must-haves), constraints (planning artifacts only, no code), and non-goals (no Narrative Engine implementation, max 3 phases for now) clearly separated.
- **Decisions:** None new; existing decisions in CONTEXT are sufficient for Plan 02.

## Ready for

Plan 02 (task breakdown, TASK-REGISTRY, README, STATE, 01-02-SUMMARY).
