# Phase 01: Planning docs baseline - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-23T06:15:02.602Z
**Status:** Ready for planning

## Phase Boundary

PROJECT, ROADMAP, and REQUIREMENTS are aligned with DungeonBreak and Narrative Engine; Phase 01 has a clear context (desired outcome, constraints, non-goals) and at least one plan with concrete tasks; TASK-REGISTRY or phase plans reflect the task breakdown.

## Implementation Decisions

- Desired outcome: PROJECT, ROADMAP, REQUIREMENTS and Phase 01 task breakdown are complete and consistent; Phase 01 has a captured context and at least one plan with clear must-haves so we can execute and verify.
- Constraints: Keep scope to planning artifacts and docs only; no code changes in Phase 01.
- Non-goals: Do not implement Narrative Engine code yet; do not add more than 3 phases to the roadmap for now.

## Implementation Discretion

- Specific implementation details not explicitly constrained above.

## Deferred Ideas

- Capture new capabilities in ROADMAP instead of expanding phase scope.
