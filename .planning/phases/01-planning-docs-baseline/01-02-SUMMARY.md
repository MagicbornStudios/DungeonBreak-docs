# Phase 01: Planning docs baseline - Plan 02 Summary

**Generated by forge-loop execute-phase**

## Tasks

- [x] 01. Ensure TASK-REGISTRY reflects Phase 01 tasks
- [x] 02. Ensure .planning README explains the loop
- [x] 03. Update STATE and create Plan 02 summary

## Outcomes

- **TASK-REGISTRY:** Phase 01 tasks listed (align docs, discuss-phase, plan-phase, execute, verify-work); Phase 02 and 03 high-level tasks recorded. Completed items marked Done.
- **README:** `.planning/README.md` describes discuss → plan → execute → verify, key files (PROJECT, ROADMAP, REQUIREMENTS, STATE, TASK-REGISTRY, DECISIONS, ERRORS, phases, prompts), and npm commands. New contributors can run the loop from the README.
- **STATE:** Updated so next action is `forge-loop verify-work 1` (or `npm run forge-loop:verify-work -- 1 --strict`).

## Phase 01 status

Planning docs baseline is complete. All Phase 01 artifacts are in place; ready for `forge-loop verify-work 1 --strict`.
