# Phase 20-01 Summary

## Status

Completed.

## Delivered

1. Phase 20 is now active in roadmap/task/state docs with JSONL stream-ledger scope.
2. LLM turn chooser backlog item is explicitly de-scoped (`20-5` dropped).
3. New task `20-6` added for JSONL event-row streaming and low-memory viewer iteration.
4. Core planning/design docs now explicitly state:
- MCP support exists,
- deterministic runner is baseline,
- autonomous LLM gameplay is not implemented,
- future prerequisites are documented.
5. User-facing docs (`README`, `packages/engine-mcp/README`, PRD integration policy) were aligned to the same scope.

## Notes

- This summary captures policy and planning realignment only.
- Implementation work for stream-ledger output and viewer iteration continues in `20-02`.
