# References for agents

When implementing narrative systems, state-space math, character traits, or procedural content, **agents should review these references** so design matches the intended research and GDC guidance.

## GDC / talks (video and transcripts)

- **Tanya X. Short – Writing Modular Characters for System-Driven Games**  
  Orthogonal traits, higher-order meaning (suits, archetypes). Referenced in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md).  
  - Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX5-2D8SP5A  
  - Use when: defining basis vectors, character axes, narrative state dimensions.

- **Kate Compton – Practical Procedural Generation for Everyone**  
  Perceptual uniqueness vs mathematical uniqueness; "10,000 bowls of oatmeal."  
  - Search: GDC Kate Compton procedural generation  
  - Use when: tuning variety, avoiding perceptual redundancy.

- **Matt Brown – Emergent Storytelling Techniques in The Sims**  
  Authoring tools over complex AI; matching player actions to content.  
  - Search: GDC Matt Brown Sims storytelling  
  - Use when: dialog/storylet selection, authoring workflows.

- **Jesse Schell – The Nature of Order in Game Narrative**  
  Centers and coherence; Christopher Alexander patterns.  
  - Search: GDC Jesse Schell Nature of Order narrative  
  - Use when: narrative beats, world coherence.

## Where to look in this repo

- **Design decisions and narrative engine (state, Verlet, saliency, threshold):** [.planning/DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md)  
- **Game and narrative scope (vision, pillars, loops):** [.planning/PROJECT.md](PROJECT.md)  
- **Implementation phases:** [.planning/implementation-roadmap.md](implementation-roadmap.md)  
- **Phases and goals:** [.planning/ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)

Agents: review the relevant talk (video/transcript) when changing narrative or state-space behavior so the implementation stays aligned with the cited design.
