# Project State

## Current Position

Phase: 16 of 16 (complete)
Plan: 01 (GitHub release hardening)
Status: Phase 16 release hardening is complete; TypeScript runtime is canonical and package distribution is GitHub Releases tarball-first.
Last activity: Implemented semantic tag/version release checks, replay smoke gates, tarball consumer CI checks, and explicit no-npm-publish policy updates across planning/docs.

Progress: [##########] 100%

## Next Action

Define the next scoped phase (content scaling/archetype work from Phase 11 backlog) now that release hardening is complete.
