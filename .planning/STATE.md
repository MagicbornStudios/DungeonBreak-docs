# Project State

## Current Position

Phase: 24 of 24 (complete)
Plan: 05 (docs-site deploy reliability + Vercel parity loop)
Status: Phase 24 complete. Docs-site has parity build logging in GitHub Actions and current local `next build` is green after engine/package/route hardening.
Last activity: Hardened `docs-og` prerender reliability by enforcing explicit route responses and adding a catch-all OG fallback response path; local normal and parity builds are green.

Progress: [##########] 100%

## Next Action

Continue active in-progress roadmap work:
- Phase 21: finish report viewer route and analyzer closeout.
- Phase 22: optional NPC policy ID plumbing (`simulateNpcTurns`).
- Phase 23: KAPLAY runtime/screens implementation.
