# Project State

## Current Position

Phase: 24 of 24 (complete)
Plan: 05 (docs-site deploy reliability + Vercel parity loop)
Status: Phase 24 complete. Docs-site has parity build logging in GitHub Actions and current local `next build` is green after engine/package/route hardening.
Last activity: Started Phase 29 and shipped the first parity slice: engine inventory actions (`use_item`, `equip_item`, `drop_item`) plus KAPLAY inventory screen wiring, with replay fixture/hash updates.

Progress: [##########] 100%

## Next Action

Continue Phase 29 with non-stub parity work: Rune Forge purchase/re-equip flow, richer combat-state UI outputs, and dialogue screen progression state.
