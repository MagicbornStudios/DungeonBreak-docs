# Project State

## Current Position

Phase: 16 of 16 (active)
Plan: 01 (publish hardening kickoff)
Status: Phase 14 and Phase 15 are complete; TypeScript runtime is canonical and package cutover is finished.
Last activity: Completed no-grid combat parity, deterministic replay/perf gates, removed Python/notebook runtime paths, and shipped `@dungeonbreak/engine` package + consumer wiring.

Progress: [##########] 100%

## Next Action

Run Phase 16 hardening loops: release notes automation, stricter package release gates, and published-package consumption checks in CI.
