# Project State

## Current Position

Phase: 24 of 24 (complete)
Plan: 05 (docs-site deploy reliability + Vercel parity loop)
Status: Phase 24 complete. Docs-site has parity build logging in GitHub Actions and current local `next build` is green after engine/package/route hardening.
Last activity: Completed Phase 23 implementation by shipping KAPLAY first-person + ASCII grid screens (navigation/combat/action/rune forge/inventory/dialogue), single-file standalone HTML output, and a KAPLAY release workflow.

Progress: [##########] 100%

## Next Action

Run a release tag validation for `kaplay-vX.Y.Z` and verify standalone asset publishing from the new KAPLAY workflow.
