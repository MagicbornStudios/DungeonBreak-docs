# Project State

## Current Position

Phase: 16 of 16 (complete)
Plan: 01 (GitHub release hardening)
Status: Phases 11, 13, 14, 15, and 16 are complete; TypeScript runtime/package are canonical and release hardening gates are active.
Last activity: Closed Phase 11 content-scale backlog with data-driven archetype/dialogue/skill/item packs, runtime archetype surfacing, deterministic balance harness/reporting, and green build/test/e2e gates.

Progress: [##########] 100%

## Next Action

Define Phase 17 scope (new content systems and long-run balancing loops) while maintaining current release gates.
