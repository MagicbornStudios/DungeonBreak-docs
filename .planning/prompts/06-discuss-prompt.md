# Forge Loop Discuss Prompt - Phase 06

Use this prompt with a coding agent or manual execution to prepare planning context.

## Inputs
- Roadmap phase: 06 - Lab setup (uv, lab command) and notebook improvements
- Goal: Single entry `npm run lab`: uv installed if missing, then Python env + deps, then Jupyter Lab (all notebooks in one place). Rename from notebooks to lab. Notebooks: simulate Kaiza (stats, state), dialogue and vectors, threshold-based options; GDC/reference links in .planning for agents. Fast, clone-and-run setup.
- Requirements: REQ-08
- Context file: .planning/phases/06-lab-setup-uv-lab-command-and-notebook-improvements/06-CONTEXT.md

## Task
1. Review context decisions and verify scope boundaries.
2. Identify ambiguities that require clarifying assumptions.
3. Prepare a plan draft with explicit must-haves.
