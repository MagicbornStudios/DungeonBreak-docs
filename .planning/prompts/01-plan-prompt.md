# Forge Loop Plan Prompt - Phase 01

Phase: Planning docs baseline
Goal: PROJECT, ROADMAP, and REQUIREMENTS are aligned with DungeonBreak and Narrative Engine; Phase 01 has a clear context (desired outcome, constraints, non-goals) and at least one plan with concrete tasks; TASK-REGISTRY or phase plans reflect the task breakdown.

Use generated PLAN files under:

Checklist:
