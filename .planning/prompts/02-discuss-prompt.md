# Forge Loop Discuss Prompt - Phase 02

Use this prompt with a coding agent or manual execution to prepare planning context.

## Inputs
- Roadmap phase: 02 - Planning docs cleanup and narrative state-space simulations
- Goal: PRD and key decisions live in .planning; general docs/ are not extended. Simulation notebooks in `notebooks/` visualize the 3D narrative state space, saliency, dialog triggering, and Verlet+constraints so we can understand and communicate how the system will behave—no game code.
- Requirements: REQ-06
- Context file: .planning/phases/02-planning-docs-cleanup-and-narrative-state-space-simulations/02-CONTEXT.md

## Task
1. Review context decisions and verify scope boundaries.
2. Identify ambiguities that require clarifying assumptions.
3. Prepare a plan draft with explicit must-haves.
