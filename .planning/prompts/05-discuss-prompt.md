# Forge Loop Discuss Prompt - Phase 05

Use this prompt with a coding agent or manual execution to prepare planning context.

## Inputs
- Roadmap phase: 05 - Docs fold into planning and notebook tooling
- Goal: docs/ contains only image-catalog (and images). Game PRD, design decisions, and implementation roadmap folded into .planning. Notebook tooling: venv + check/install + JupyterLab from root; no single-notebook run commands. Notebooks are documentation (entities/vectors/dialogue in same space; threshold and options for follow-up).
- Requirements: REQ-07
- Context file: .planning/phases/05-docs-fold-into-planning-and-notebook-tooling/05-CONTEXT.md

## Task
1. Review context decisions and verify scope boundaries.
2. Identify ambiguities that require clarifying assumptions.
3. Prepare a plan draft with explicit must-haves.
