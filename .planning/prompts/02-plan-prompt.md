# Forge Loop Plan Prompt - Phase 02

Phase: Planning docs cleanup and narrative state-space simulations
Goal: PRD and key decisions live in .planning; general docs/ are not extended. Simulation notebooks in `notebooks/` visualize the 3D narrative state space, saliency, dialog triggering, and Verlet+constraints so we can understand and communicate how the system will behave—no game code.

Use generated PLAN files under:
.planning/phases/02-planning-docs-cleanup-and-narrative-state-space-simulations

Checklist:
1. Validate required frontmatter fields.
2. Confirm wave ordering and dependencies.
3. Ensure must_haves map to observable behavior.
