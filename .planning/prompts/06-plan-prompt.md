# Forge Loop Plan Prompt - Phase 06

Phase: Lab setup (uv, lab command) and notebook improvements
Goal: Single entry `npm run lab`: uv installed if missing, then Python env + deps, then Jupyter Lab (all notebooks in one place). Rename from notebooks to lab. Notebooks: simulate Kaiza (stats, state), dialogue and vectors, threshold-based options; GDC/reference links in .planning for agents. Fast, clone-and-run setup.

Checklist:
1. Validate required frontmatter fields.
2. Confirm wave ordering and dependencies.
3. Ensure must_haves map to observable behavior.
