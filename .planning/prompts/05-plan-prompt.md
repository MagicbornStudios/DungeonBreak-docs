# Forge Loop Plan Prompt - Phase 05

Phase: Docs fold into planning and notebook tooling
Goal: docs/ contains only image-catalog (and images). Game PRD, design decisions, and implementation roadmap folded into .planning. Notebook tooling: venv + check/install + JupyterLab from root; no single-notebook run commands. Notebooks are documentation (entities/vectors/dialogue in same space; threshold and options for follow-up).

Use generated PLAN files under:
.planning/phases/05-docs-fold-into-planning-and-notebook-tooling

Checklist:
1. Validate required frontmatter fields.
2. Confirm wave ordering and dependencies.
3. Ensure must_haves map to observable behavior.
