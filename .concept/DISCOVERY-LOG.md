## From initial simulation (2025-02-27)

- [ ] **DISCOVERY-001** — First treasure cutscene ("A Locked Cache") lacks follow-up dialogue or player reaction moment.
- [ ] **DISCOVERY-002** — No clear feedback when approaching skill unlock (e.g., Appraisal)—player doesn't know they're "close" until they check skills.
- [ ] **DISCOVERY-003** — Signal in the Dark: verify Fame threshold (strict 1 vs cumulative).
- [ ] **DISCOVERY-004** — Corridor room descriptions feel generic; treasure rooms could use more distinct flavor per depth.
